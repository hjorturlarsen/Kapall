There are 35 cards on the table (7 cards in 5 columns). z
In the beginning the deck in the lower left corner z
[called "A"] includes 17 cards that all face down. z
You can click on A and the top card will be put face up z
right beside A so there will be a new deck of cards that z
all face up [lets call this deck "B"]. z
Now you can take card of 1 rank lower or 1 rank higher z
from the table and drag it onto the top card in B. z
Note that a Dolan can be placed onto a Pruto z 
and vice versa. z
Also the "Wild Card" can be placed on any card and z
any card can be placed on the "Wild Card" z .
