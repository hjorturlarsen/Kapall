Dolan Solitaire
======
###How the game works
There are 35 cards on the table (5 cards in 7 columns).
In the beginning the deck in the lower left corner
(called "A") includes 17 cards that all face down.
You can click on A and the top card will be put face up
right beside A so there will be a new deck of cards that
all face up (lets call this deck "B").
Now you can take card of 1 rank lower or 1 rank higher
from the table and drag it onto the top card in B.
Note that a Dolan can be placed onto a Pruto 
and vice versa.
Also the "Wild Card" can be placed on any card and
any card can be placed on the "Wild Card".
The game is won when all the cards have been removed from the 7 collumns.
The game is lost when there are no cards left in A and none of the cards in 
the collumns can be placed on B.

###Functions
- When the game is won you can insert your initials and store your time and score. 
- The top 15 scores can be seen by toggling "h" on the keyboard.
- Instructions on how to play the game can be seen by toggling "i" on the keyboard.
- A new game can be started by pressing "n" on the keyboard.
- The game lets you know when the game is lost.
